# General instructions

This repo focuses on `songml` -- a custom language for expressing music, like a musician's leadsheet.

## Key files:

`docs/songml-syntax.md`: semi-formal, describes the semantics of language elements

`samples/youve-got-a-way.songml`: example of a real song notated this way.

## Philosophy

`songml` is a tool for the age of AI: without being focused on strict linguistic rules, it's fairly relaxed and forgiving -- in most cases the LLM and human can both understand, and any old-school tools which consume or produce it are designed with this "sloppiness" in mind.
